# Wordle (Android)

This project recreates the popular [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) word-guessing game for Android devices. It has been built using Java and includes a range of features to enhance the player experience.

## Features
- Global leaderboard: players can compete against others from around the world and see how they rank on the leaderboard
- Player profile: players can create a profile with their name and profile picture
- Replayability: players can replay the game multiple times to improve their score and ranking on the leaderboard
- Results-sharing: players can share their game results with friends (over any app they like)
- Profile picture customization: players can choose to customize their profile picture using either the camera or the gallery

## Demo
[A video demo of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijJZk-T_530). NOTE: In the demo, I say the share and replay buttons don’t work if the game is not over, but
I meant they’re not visible and not enabled.
## Installation

You can install this app on an Emulator with API 29 and higher within Android Studio.
